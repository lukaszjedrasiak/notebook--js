Heaps are another variation of the tree data structure and are adept at keeping track of the maximum or minimum value held within, referred to as max-heaps and min-heaps, respectively.

Specifically, heaps are a type of binary tree, since each child node is either greater or less than its parent (depending on if itâ€™s a max-heap or min-heap). They are efficient for accessing the root value, which will either be the max or min (again, depending on the type of heap) and inserting new values.
