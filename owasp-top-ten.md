1. **Injection:** An attacker “injects” malicious code into an interpreter, usually through an input field, in order to gain access to information or damage a system
2. **Broken Authentication:** An insecure authentication system allows attackers to impersonate other users.
3. **Sensitive Data Exposure:** Sensitive data is improperly or insufficiently protected.
4. **XML External Entities (XXE):** Malicious XML causes an insecure XML processor to access data or execute code that it shouldn’t.
5. **Broken Access Control:** Authorization isn’t properly enforced, allowing attackers to access resources beyond their authorization.
6. **Security Misconfiguration:** Insecure, improper, or a lack of security configurations degrade the security of an environment.
7. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Malicious input is treated as javascript that can run on victims’ browsers.
8. **Insecure Deserialization:** Data from an untrusted source is deserialized into an object, potentially containing malicious code or data, within a program.
9. **Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities:** Vulnerable components, such as out-of-date packages or software, are included within an environment, allowing attackers to use existing exploits to attack.
10. **Insufficient Logging and Monitoring:** Lack of detailed monitoring makes it easier for attackers to stay undetected, and it makes it harder to respond after an attack has occurred.
