Trees are used for data that has a hierarchical structure, such as a family tree or a computer’s file system. The tree data structure you are going to create is an excellent foundation for further variations on trees, including AVL trees, red-black trees, and binary trees.

A _binary tree_ is a type of tree where each parent can have **no more than two children**, known as the _left child_ and _right child_.
