JavaScript is an objective oriented language. It means, that you do not define global functions, which operate on different data types. Instead, you use different data types, which has defined methods.

I.e. If you want to sort an array you do not call function `sort(array)`, but call method `array.sort()`.

> Primitives data types are **mutable** and objects are **immutable**.

6. [[undefined]]
